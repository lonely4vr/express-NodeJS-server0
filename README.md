 the conditional routing is implemented by conditionally sending responses or passing control to the next route based on the random condition defined in the first route handler for the /foo path.
 The regular expression /^\/user(name)?$/ matches URLs starting with /user, optionally followed by the string "name". This allows it to handle both /user and /username routes.
